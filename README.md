# MultiCons: Multiple Consensus Clustering using Closed Patterns
Objective: Combine clustering results in order to identify clustering patterns agreed by different numbers of clustering, using frequent closed patterns, and generate new consensus clustering solutions. These consensus clustering solutions are then presented in a tree structure that allows the end-user to better understand the properties of the data space, by identifying strong clusters and unstable instances from the viewpoint of clustering, and determine the best consensus solution according to his/her prior knowledge of the application. \
\
Implementation: R Language. \
